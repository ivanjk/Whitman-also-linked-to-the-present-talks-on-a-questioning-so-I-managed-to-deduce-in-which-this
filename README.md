# Whitman-also-linked-to-the-present-talks-on-a-questioning-so-I-managed-to-deduce-in-which-this
Whitman, also linked to the present, talks on a "questioning" (so I managed to deduce) in which this would be represented as reality and also be included in this questioning the future that would be the analysis of this, however, in the reality (present) Whitman cites the following: "I feel happy-see, dance, river and singing" here talks about how happy he feels, realizing their thoughts and acts, but in part that focuses more this questioning makes reference Whitman as said earlier, is in the analysis, ie in the future since being happy as he says, his own thoughts he questions if they are true, because it's hard to believe if his actions, whether a person or object are feasible
